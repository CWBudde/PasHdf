# PasHdf

A library to load HDF files with Object Pascal. At the moment it's only a subset for partially reading HDF files, but with some help this could get expanded fully read and write all types of HDF files.

## Disclaimer
The code is based on the original [HDF specifications](https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/H5.format.html) and the source code of [libmysofa](https://github.com/hoene/libmysofa). However, in contrast to the latter source this library should not include functions for HRTFs.
